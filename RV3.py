import random
print ("Hello World!")
#2. Create three variables that each randomly generate an integer between 1 and 10, print each number on the same line.
a = random.randint(1,10)
b = random.randint(1,10)
c = random.randint(1,10)
print (a,b,c)
#3. Create a list containing 5 strings listing 5 colors.
d = ["RED","GREEN","BLUE","YELLOW","MAGENTA"]
#4. Use a function to randomly choose one of the 5 colors from the list and print the result.
print (d[random.randint(0,4 )])
#5. Create an if statement that determines which of the three variables from #2 is the lowest.
if a < b and a < c:
    print ("a is lowest")
else:
    if b < c and b < a:
        print("b is lowest")
    else:
        if c < a and c < b:
            print("c is lowest")
        else:
            print("no lowest")
